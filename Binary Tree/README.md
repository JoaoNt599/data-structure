# Binary Tree


## A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure composed of nodes, where each node has at most two children, typically referred to as the "left child" and "right child." Each node contains a value or key, and the relationship between nodes reflects a specific order.

## Key terms associated with binary trees:

### Parent Node: The node that has children in a tree.

### Child Node: Each node can have up to two children, referred to as the "left child" and "right child."

### Leaf Node: A node that has no children.

### Root: The top node in the tree hierarchy, which has no parent node.

### Subtree: A tree formed by a node and all its descendants.

### Tree Height: The length of the longest path from the root to a leaf.

### Node Level: The distance between the node and the root, with the root at level 0.

### Binary Search Tree (BST): A specific type of binary tree where, for each node:
###     The values of nodes in the left subtree are less than the value of the node.
###     The values of nodes in the right subtree are greater than the value of the node.
###     This property facilitates efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.

## The structure of a binary tree facilitates quick search in ordered data and provides a foundation for many algorithms and data structures. Binary trees are widely used in computer science to represent hierarchical data and perform efficient operations on ordered datasets.
